# TestFrameWork
building a simple test framework utilizing POM and python along side selenium

For full disclosure I did not come up with this implementation by myself. I barrowed from a number of other developers work to 
piece together a framework that in my opinion works pretty slick for running a webdriver. 

The two that are barrowed from most heavily are 
https://github.com/dakotasmith - Dakota Smith who implemented a brilliant selenium grid framework. 
https://github.com/Element-34 - Adam Goucher who layed the foundation for a lot of this implemtation.
